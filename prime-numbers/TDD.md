# Test Driven Development

## What is TDD?

Test Driven Development is the coding practice that starts writing code by writing the tests.
In TDD, testing and quality assurance is built into the coding process and time table.
As you will see from our example today, in TDD, the tests guide and drive the code. We will work in short cycles. First we write our unit test, and the test should fail. Then we write the least amount of code necessary to make the test pass. We then write another test to further define what our objective. Every time there is a red bar, or a failing test, we return to the code to change it in order to make the tests pass. This iterative technique helps us to define clearly what our objective is, to write the simplest solution to pass each test case, and to continue to review our code to refactor it for cleaner code. And we know that our refactor works because we have the test suite to prove it!

## Our Project

Prime Factors Kata

### What is a Kata?

Kata is a term used by some programmers in the Software Craftsmanship movement. A kata is a small snippet of code that you write in one sitting, sometimes repeatedly, often daily, in order to build muscle memory and practise your craft.

### Our Objectives

Our task is to build an algorithm that will break down any number into its prime factors. This can be broken down into three rules.
The three rules are as follows:

1. is numb divisible by 2
2. if true, divide by 2. if false, increase candidate and try again.
3. repeat
